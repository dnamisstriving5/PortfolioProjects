:round_pushpin:	**About**

Welcome to my project on the Tiki e-commerce platform! This project focuses on analyzing two popular product categories: bags and shoes. We will conduct a series of studies and analyses to gain a deeper understanding of shopping trends, customer preferences, and factors influencing the success of products in these two categories.

**I, Some main discoveries in SQL**
***Note**: 
- I deleted "Cây cảnh", "Bàn ghế các loại" and "Kính Hiển Vi" because they are not included in shoe categories.
- "Root" is plastic sandals
-  I still have some ideas about favourite_count column but somehow the dataset I use in kaggle has nothing.
